# syntax-library
 A library for Programmers to differentiate syntax of various Programming Languages

 A brief history of the languages and Syntaxes are in the markdown (.md) file in
 the subfolders of the "Programming Languages" directory with their
 respective names (i.e. python, c, cpp, javascript)

 ### Note: This is for experienced programmers,
 who already know how to code and are thinking of learning a 'new' language
 or revising previously known ones
